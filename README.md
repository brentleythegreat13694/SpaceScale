# SpaceScale

**SpaceScale** is a calculator that calculates your weight on earth to how much you would weigh on a different planet

## How to compile

To turn the source code (`main.c`) into a executable (`SpaceScale.exe`), follow these steps:

### 1. Complier
You need a C complier installed (like **GCC** via MinGW). You can check if you have it by typing this command in your terminal '''powershell gcc --version **Don't have one??** Download this one i like but either one you like would be fine [Win64Devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases/tag/v2.5.0) and if you don't know what a terminal is don't worry follow this next step

### 2. Find terminal if you don't know where it is
For windows systems the terminal is either **powershell** or **Command Prompt** so search up **Command Prompt** on your windows machine then run it either as a admin or normally

### 3. Navigate to folder
Type in your **Powershell** or **Command Prompt** cd "C:\Users\Yourusernamehere\Downloads\SpaceScale\src"

### 4. Run the program
Type this in your **Powershell** or **Command Prompt** gcc main.c -o SpaceScale.exe then to run it is .\SpaceScale.exe
